# cmorley191/demofile-net

Fork of [saul/demofile-net](https://github.com/saul/demofile-net): a C# parser foundation for replay files called "demos" (.dem), which contain complete data for matches played in online video games built on the Source 2 engine, such as *[Deadlock](https://github.com/cmorley191/SchemaGenDemofileNet-cm191/blob/main/what_is_deadlock.md)*.

This fork has various changes that I need for other projects:
- Uses [cmorley191/SchemaGenDemofileNet-cm191](https://github.com/[cmorley191/SchemaGenDemofileNet-cm191) - an alternative method for keeping the library's demo file schema up to date with *Deadlock*'s developer updates - rather than using [saul/CS2SchemaGen](https://github.com/saul/CS2SchemaGen)
  - See [UPDATING_SCHEMA.md](UPDATING_SCHEMA.md)
- Minor changes to various other functionality
